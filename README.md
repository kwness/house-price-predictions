# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge - Kyle Ness

There are a lot of factors that go into the pricing of homes / real estate. Some of these may be obvious and their effects on price well-known, like the total area of a home in square feet or the number of bedrooms and baths the house has. Others, however, may be more abstract or subjectively valued, like whether a house has a masonry veneer or how long the frontage of the house's lot is. Further, there may be many significant interactions between the variables of a house that also affect valuation. Thus, analyzing the Ames, Iowa housing dataset consisting of 2,051 observations on 80 independent variables, it should be possible to arrive at a model that will accurately estimate a given home's sale price despite the complexity of the task. Thus, this report seeks to help the average homeowner be more informed about their property's value and valuations in RE markets in general.

### Analysis - Summary
Analysis was conducted on a dataset containing 2,051 observations on 80 features of houses sold in Ames, Iowa. After data cleaning, EDA, and relationship plotting, a multi linear regression model was fitted to the 10 features most correlated with the target variable, house sale price. This model was then used to predict the sale prices of houses excluded from the training dataset. An R^2 of roughly 0.83 was reached.
